Every time you want to update code:
1. Upload latest version from Github to Godot (preferably newest branch so that we can build off of stuff)
2. Make changes
3. Export changes
4. Upload to Github, open new branch
5. Once 1 other team members sign off on it, commit changes
6. Delete old files (straight commit)

If at any point you don't know how to do something... you're using chrome just google it
Alternatively, pester Lucas if that is somehow more convenient
